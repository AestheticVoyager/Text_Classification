# Text_Classification
What is Text Classification?

Text classification is a machine learning technique that assigns a set of predefined categories to open-ended text. 
Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize pretty much any kind of text â€“ from documents, medical studies and files, and all over the web.

For example, new articles can be organized by topics; support tickets can be organized by urgency; chat conversations can be organized by language; brand mentions can be organized by sentiment; and so on.

Text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing with broad applications such as sentiment analysis, topic labeling, spam detection, and intent detection.
